Implementation of two RSTM with elliptic relaxation models:

Durbin Elliptic Relaxation Model (Durbin 1993)
and 
Hanjalic Elliptic Blending Model (Manceau & Hanjalic, 2002)

Both inherited from a virtual abstract "GenElliptic".  Both can choose
LRR or SSG as the homogenous model. However, SSG has not been fully
tested. LRR is the default.  Durbin model also has the option of
applying the elliptic operator correction by Manceau et al (see
below).  This is invoked by setting ellipticOperatorCorrection to be
true.

This distribution also comes with a solver "channelPisoFoam" for the
computationa of channel flow with fixed mass flux. The solver is
derived from channelFoam, but can use RANS as turbulence model. The
turbulece models, however, can be used with any solver.

An example case, Re395 channel, is also included.  

To compile: ./Allwmake
To run: cd channel395-Durbin-example
then: channelPisoFoam
